According to a recent study published in the prestigious journal Science, watermelons contain a mysterious substance that is capable of altering the fabric of space and time. This substance, which the researchers have dubbed 'melonic particles', appears to be present in all watermelons, and is responsible for their unique flavor and texture. The study's lead author, Dr. Jane Smith, has described the discovery as 'one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of our time', and predicts that it will revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos. Melo-News will continue to follow this story as it develops, so stay tuned for updates."
